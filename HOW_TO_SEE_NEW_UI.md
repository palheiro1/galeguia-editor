2. Go to your course list
3. **Click on any existing course** (not "Create New Course")
4. You'll now see the **NEW CourseBuilderScreen** instead of the old interface!

### Key Features You'll See:
- âœ… **Visual Hierarchy Tree**: Expandable course structure

- âœ… **Color-Coded Page Types**: Visual guide explaining page types
- âœ… **Completion Status**: Icons showing what's done vs pending
- âœ… **Quick Actions**: Intuitive buttons for adding content

### 2. **Testing the New Grain Editor**
1. In the new Course Builder, click **"+ Grain"** on any page
2. You'll see the **NEW ImprovedGrainEditorScreen** with:

   - âœ… **Smart Forms**: Dynamic fields based on grain type
   - âœ… **Type Enforcement**: Automatic selection for page patterns

## ðŸ”„ What Changed vs Old Interface:

### **OLD Course Editing (Create New Course still uses this):**
- Complex text-based lists
- No visual hierarchy
- Confusing navigation
- No progress feedback
- Overwhelming grain creation

### **NEW Course Building (Edit Existing Course now uses this):**
- Visual tree structure with expand/collapse
- Clear progress tracking
- Educational guides
- Intuitive navigation
- Simplified grain creation with examples

## ðŸš€ Navigation Flow Now:

```
Course List Screen
â”œâ”€â”€ "Create New Course" â†’ Old CourseEditScreen (for course setup)
â””â”€â”€ "Edit Course" â†’ NEW CourseBuilderScreen (for content management)
    â””â”€â”€ "+ Grain" â†’ NEW ImprovedGrainEditorScreen
```

## ðŸ“± How to Test Right Now:

1. **Open the app** (should be running on localhost:8081)
2. **Log in** to your account
3. **Click on any existing course** in your course list
4. **See the NEW visual interface** with the tree structure and progress bars!
5. **Click "+ Grain"** on any page to see the new grain editor

## ðŸŽ¨ Visual Improvements You'll Notice:

- **Color-coded page types** (Introduction=Green, Booster=Blue, etc.)
- **Progress bars** showing how many grains are complete (0-15)
- **Hierarchical indentation** showing course structure depth
- **Educational tooltips** explaining what each page type does
- **Visual grain type selection** with examples and descriptions

The interface is **dramatically different** and much more intuitive than the old text-based lists!
